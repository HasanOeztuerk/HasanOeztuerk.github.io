Hasan C. Öztürk - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my professional portfolio website, showcasing my evolving journey in project management, agile methodologies, and creative development. As a certified Scrum Master (PSM I) and Project Management Associate (CAPM)®, I combine structured leadership approaches with my passion for interactive storytelling and game design.

This responsive website, built with HTML and CSS, reflects my multidisciplinary background spanning:

Project Leadership: Certified in Agile methodologies (Scrum.org), Jira workflows, and Google Project Management principles

Technical Development: Skills in Python, Lua, and Unity development, demonstrated through interactive projects

Creative Design: 3D modeling, game narrative design, and digital art creation

The portfolio highlights my professional transition from academic research in Digital Humanities to practical project management, while maintaining game development as a creative pursuit. Key sections include:

Projects featuring my Twine-based interactive fiction The Catacombs of Cathruban and Love2D game Ghost Hunter, demonstrating my technical implementation of narrative systems.

Certifications documenting my professional credentials from PMI, Scrum.org, and Coursera, with verifiable certificates in project management fundamentals.

Art Portfolio showcasing 3D models, concept art, and game assets created in Blender and traditional media, reflecting my visual design skills.

About Me detailing my academic background in Interdisciplinary American Studies (BA) and Digital Humanities (MA), and how these inform my approach to project leadership and interactive media.

Currently pursuing additional certifications while developing my technical skills, this portfolio represents my commitment to bridging creative development with agile project management - whether coordinating teams or designing immersive experiences in my personal projects. The site itself demonstrates my front-end development capabilities and design sensibility.
